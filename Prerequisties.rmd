## Pre-requisites

  *  Maths
      + [Reltionship between Logarithms & Exponents](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/logs.htm)
      
  * Calculus - is about **Limits**. Limits allow us to see how things **change**. A branch of calculus deals with the "curves & slopes" is called **Differential Calculs*. The slopes are nothing but tangent lines at a point. These slopes are called **derivaties** or **gradient**. 
  The other branch of Calculus deals with "areas (or volumes)" is called "integrals". For example, find out the area under the curve? etc.

     + [Differentiation / Derivaties / Gradient ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq3vqarm-VQ)
      
      + Geometry : Deals with Shapes ( circumference, area etc)
      
      + Trignometry : Deals with triangles (interior angles, hypotenuse)
      
      + Linear Algebra : Deals with equations
      
      + Matrices
      
        
      
  * Probablity & Statistics
     + [Statistics explained with pictures](http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/index.html)
     + [Online lectures](http://www.ilectureonline.com/lectures/subject/MATH/18/164/1670)
     + Basics
       + Conditional Probability (Conditioning)
         Two dependent events.
         P(E|F) => Probability of E given F.
         P(lung cancer | smoker) - the probability of having lung cancer given that you are a smoker.
       + *Bayes's Theorem*
         P(A|B) = P(A & B) / P(B) 
                = P(B|A)P(A) / (P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|~A)P(~A))
          
         The conditional prob P(B|A) is also called as *likelihood*
         The *log-likelihood* is nothing but log(P(B|A)).
         
         In general, the log likelihood is preferred in Machine learning because, it is easy to calculate the derivatives.
         
       + Marginalisation

       + Co-variance
       
    * Probability Distribution
      + The Normal Distribution
        + Also known as Gaussian Distribution
      + The Binomial Distribution
      + Central Limit Theorem
    * Hypothesis Testing
      + Confidence interval
      + p-value => probability value
    * The Correlation coefficient
       
  
## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics  are used to describe the basic features of the data in study.
They provide the quantitative data in a manageable form. ie., simplify the large amount of data in a sensible way.

There are three characterstics for a single variable that we tend to look at:

   1) *Measures of Central Tendency*
         + Also, known as measures of location.
         + The idea of central tendency is to give you the idea of what a typical value for a variable.
         + Mean => average value
         + Median  => sort the values in ascending / decending order and pick the mid value
         + Mode => frequently occuring value
    
    2) *Measures of Dispersion*
         + It refers to how much the value of the variable is "spread out".
         + Following are some measures of Dispersion:
           + Range => difference between the highest and lowest value
           + Interquartile Range => difference between 75th and 25th percentile values.
           + Variance, Standard Deviation:
              It shows how much the individual values in a dataset are vary from mean / average value.
 
     3) *Distribution*
         It is the summary of the frequency of individual or range of values for a variable.
The different kinds of distributions are:

       1) Uniform Distribution
       2) Berouli Distribution (aka Binomial)
       3) Multinomial Distribution
       4) Gaussian Distribution (aka Bell Curve)
       
### Correlation
  Correlation describes the relationship between the two *variables*. The relationship refers to the *corresspondence* between the two variables. The correlation relationship simply says that the two variables perform in a synchronised manner.
  
  
## Inferential Statistics
   Inferential statistics helps to make inference from data. The major inferential statistics come from statistical model called *General Linerar Model (GLM)*.
   
   The GLM provides the foundation for the following statistical methods:
   
   1) t-test
   2) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
   3) Analysis of CoVariance (ANCOVA)
   4) Regression Analysis
   5) MultiVariate Methods:
       a) Factor Analysis
       b) Cluster Analysis
       c) Multidimensional Scaling
       d) Discriminant Function Analysis
       e) Canonical Correlation
