## Pre-requisites

  *  Maths
      + [Reltionship between Logarithms & Exponents](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/logs.htm)
      
  * Calculus - is about **Limits**. Limits allow us to see how things **change**. A branch of calculus deals with the "curves & slopes" is called **Differential Calculs*. The slopes are nothing but tangent lines at a point. These slopes are called **derivaties** or **gradient**. 
  The other branch of Calculus deals with "areas (or volumes)" is called "integrals". For example, find out the area under the curve? etc.
