## Pre-requisites

  *  Maths
      + [Reltionship between Logarithms & Exponents](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/logs.htm)
      
  * Calculus - is about **Limits**. Limits allow us to see how things **change**. A branch of calculus deals with the "curves & slopes" is called **Differential Calculs*. The slopes are nothing but tangent lines at a point. These slopes are called **derivaties** or **gradient**. 
  The other branch of Calculus deals with "areas (or volumes)" is called "integrals". For example, find out the area under the curve? etc.

      + Geometry : Deals with Shapes ( circumference, area etc)
      
      + Trignometry : Deals with triangles (interior angles, hypotenuse)
      
      + Linear Algebra : Deals with equations

  * Probablity & Statistics
     + [Statistics explained with pictures](http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/index.html)
     + [Online lectures](http://www.ilectureonline.com/lectures/subject/MATH/18/164/1670)
     + Basics
       + Conditional Probability (Conditioning)
         Two dependent events.
         P(E|F) => Probability of E given F.
         P(lung cancer | smoker) - the probability of having lung cancer given that you are a smoker.
       + *Bayes's Theorem*
         P(A|B) = P(A & B) / P(B) 
                = P(B|A)P(A) / (P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|~A)P(~A))
          
       + Marginalisation
       + *Measures of Central Tendency*
         + Also, known as measures of location.
         + The idea of central tendency is to give you the idea of what a typical value for a variable.
         + Mean => average value
         + Median  => sort the values in ascending / decending order and pick the mid value
         + Mode => frequently occuring value
       + *Measures of Dispersion*
         + It refers to how much the value of the variable is "spread out".
         + Following are some measures of Dispersion:
           + Range => difference between the highest and lowest value
           + Interquartile Range => difference between 75th and 25th percentile values.
           + Variance, Standard Deviation:
              It shows how much the individual values in a dataset are vary from mean / average value.
       + Co-variance
       
    * Probability Distribution
      + The Normal Distribution
        + Also known as Gaussian Distribution
      + The Binomial Distribution
      + Central Limit Theorem
    * Hypothesis Testing
      + Confidence interval
      + p-value => probability value
    * The Correlation coefficient
