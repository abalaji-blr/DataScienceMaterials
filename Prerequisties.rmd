  * Calculus - is about **Limits**. Limits allow us to see how things **change**. A branch of calculus deals with the "curves & slopes" is called **Differential Calculs*. The slopes are nothing but tangent lines at a point. These slopes are called **derivaties** or **gradient**. 
  The other branch of Calculus deals with "areas (or volumes)" is called "integrals". For example, find out the area under the curve? etc.

## Linear Algebra 
  
  The following are the different mathematical objects: Scalar, Vector, Matrices and Tensor (array with more than two axes).
  
  Matrix operations: The matrix operations provides a *transformation* (scale / rotate / shear / flip) of the data.
  
   0) Addition C = A + B
   1) Subtraction C = A - B
   2) Product C = AB
   2b) Determinant of a matrix
       * It is just a number
       * Determinant can be calculated only for square matrices.
       * If the determinant is zero, then there won't exist the inverse matrix and
         that matrix is called *singular* matrix.
         
       * Invertible Matrix: Each point in one space can be transformed to a point in the newly transformed space. The transform of these points can be reversed. Such transformation matrix is called *Invertible Matrix*.
       
       * Non-invertible matrix: When many points in one vector space transforms to the same point in the destination space. Then we can't reverse those transformations.
       
       * det(AB) = det(A).det(B)

   3) Distributive A(B+C) = AB + AC
   4) Associative A(BC) = (AB)C
   5) Identity Matrix AI = A,
      Where I is identify matrix, the main diagonal elements are ONE.
   6) Inversion (A^-1)A = I (or) A(A^-1) = I
   7) Norm: Length of the vector.
       L1 norm:
       L2 norm:
   8) Special Matrices & Vectors:
      a) Diagonal matrix
      b) Orthogonal matrix : (A^T)A = A(A^T) = I
         which implies that (A^T) = (A^-1)
         
    9) EigenDecomposition
       * Eigen Vector: The word *Eigen* is a German word, meaning *self / own / specific / inherient*. The vector is does not change the direction of the transformation is called eigen vector.
       A matrix can be decomposed into eigen vector and eigen values.
       
    10) Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
        The SVD provides way to decompose matrix into singular vector and singular value.
        
        A = UD(V^T)
        
        where A => mxn matrix
              U => mxm matrix, orthogonal matrix
              D => mxn matrix, diagonal matrix
              V => nxn matrix, orthogonal matrix
              
        The values along the diagonal D are called *singular values*.
        The columns of U are called *left-singular vectors*.
        The columns of V are called *right-singular vectors*.
      
## Numerical Computation
   This deals with solving problems in a iterative process instead of analytically deriving a formula.

     + [Online lectures](http://www.ilectureonline.com/lectures/subject/MATH/18/164/1670)
     + Basics
       + Conditional Probability (Conditioning)
         Two dependent events.
         P(E|F) => Probability of E given F.
         P(lung cancer | smoker) - the probability of having lung cancer given that you are a smoker.
       + *Bayes's Theorem*
         P(A|B) = P(A & B) / P(B) 
                = P(B|A)P(A) / (P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|~A)P(~A))
          
         The conditional prob P(B|A) is also called as *likelihood*
         The *log-likelihood* is nothing but log(P(B|A)).
         
         In general, the log likelihood is preferred in Machine learning because, it is easy to calculate the derivatives.
         
       + Marginalisation

       + Co-variance
       
    * Probability Distribution
      + The Normal Distribution
        + Also known as Gaussian Distribution
      + The Binomial Distribution
      + Central Limit Theorem
    * Hypothesis Testing
      + Confidence interval
      + p-value => probability value
    * The Correlation coefficient
       
  
## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics  are used to describe the basic features of the data in study.
They provide the quantitative data in a manageable form. ie., simplify the large amount of data in a sensible way.

There are three characterstics for a single variable that we tend to look at:

   1) *Measures of Central Tendency*
         + Also, known as measures of location.
         + The idea of central tendency is to give you the idea of what a typical value for a variable.
         + Mean => average value
         + Median  => sort the values in ascending / decending order and pick the mid value
         + Mode => frequently occuring value
    
    2) *Measures of Dispersion*
         + It refers to how much the value of the variable is "spread out".
         + Following are some measures of Dispersion:
           + Range => difference between the highest and lowest value
           + Interquartile Range => difference between 75th and 25th percentile values.
           + Variance, Standard Deviation:
              It shows how much the individual values in a dataset are vary from mean / average value.
 
     3) *Distribution*
         It is the summary of the frequency of individual or range of values for a variable.
The different kinds of distributions are:

       1) Uniform Distribution
       2) Berouli Distribution (aka Binomial)
       3) Multinomial Distribution
       4) Gaussian Distribution (aka Bell Curve)
       
### Correlation
  Correlation describes the relationship between the two *variables*. The relationship refers to the *corresspondence* between the two variables. The correlation relationship simply says that the two variables perform in a synchronised manner.
  
  
## Inferential Statistics
   Inferential statistics helps to make inference from data. The major inferential statistics come from statistical model called *General Linerar Model (GLM)*.
   
   The GLM provides the foundation for the following statistical methods:
   
   1) t-test
   2) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
   3) Analysis of CoVariance (ANCOVA)
   4) Regression Analysis
   5) MultiVariate Methods:
       a) Factor Analysis
       b) Cluster Analysis
       c) Multidimensional Scaling
       d) Discriminant Function Analysis
       e) Canonical Correlation

### Probability & Statistics FAQs:

  * What is difference between Probablity & Statistics?
  
     Probability:
     Statistics:
     
  * What is difference between *discrete and continuous* probability distribution?
  
    Discrete Distribution :  the variable can take a value from a set of values.
    Continuous Distribution: Any value in the range.

 * What is the difference between *prior and posterior* in statistics?
 
   *Prior*: is the probability distribution that represents the uncertainity over your interested variable before you have sampled any data and tried to predict it.
   
   *Posterior*: is the probability distribution that represents the uncertainity over the interested variables after sampling. It is a conditional distribution because it conditions of the sampled data.
