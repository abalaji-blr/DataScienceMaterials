## Notes

**Types of Neural Network**

1. Feed Forward Network
2. Recurrent Network. (has cycles)
3. Symmetric Network.

* Perceptron is an aritifical Neuron. It has inputs and their weights. They are summed up and transformed to get the output.

** Following are different kind of transformations**
  1) Unit step (threshold)
  2) Sigmoid
     + Logistic Sigmoid: Value range from 0 to 1
     + Tangential Sigmoid: Value range from -1 to +1
     
  3) Piecewise Linear
  4) Gaussian Function (aka bell shaped curve)
