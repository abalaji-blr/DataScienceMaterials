## Notes

**Types of Neural Network**

1. Feed Forward Network
2. Recurrent Network. (has cycles)
3. Symmetric Network.

* Perceptron is an aritifical Neuron. It has inputs and their weights. They are summed up and transformed to get the output.

** Following are different kind of transformations**
  1) Unit step (threshold)
  2) Sigmoid
     + Logistic Sigmoid: Value range from 0 to 1
     + Tangential Sigmoid: Value range from -1 to +1
     
  3) Piecewise Linear
  4) Gaussian Function (aka bell shaped curve)
  
  

 * Convolutional Neural network
 
  This is a type of feed forward neural network, also called as CNN or ConvNet. This models the animal visual perception. This can be applied for visual recognition tasks.
  
  The setup of the network will be something like below:
  
  Input Layer -> Convolution Layer -> Other Hidden Layer -> Output Layer
  
  **The Convolution Layer** : is built using a learnable filter (aka Kernel or patch). The filter is a small neural network (with certain k outputs). The filter scans through the input layer and generates the convolution layer with more depth. This is called convolution. So, network may have multiple convolution layer (basically pyramid structure in terms of increase in the depth, decrease in the image size or spatial information is sequeezed out) before sending it to classifier.
  
  The filter / path, works due to **Statistical Invariance** (Translational invariance). Basically use the bounding box and if the image appears any where in the box, they are treated same. In other words, the share the **same weights**.
